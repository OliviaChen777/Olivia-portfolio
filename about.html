        <h3>
          I am a former professional badminton player with a Master's degree in
          Education, and I am currently transitioning into the tech industry.
          After my athletic career, I developed a strong interest in software
          development, which led me to pursue a boot camp focused on full-stack
          web development. Through this experience, I am gaining proficiency in
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more, and I'm excited to apply my newly
          acquired skills in real-world projects.

        <h3>
          Outside of work, I am passionate about hiking and exploring nature.
          Hiking allows me to disconnect, challenge myself, and build
          resilience, similar to how I approach learning in the tech field. I
          also have a strong athletic background as a former professional
          badminton player, where I learned the importance of discipline, focus,
          and teamwork—skills I continue to apply in my professional life.
